1. Strings are the ordered sequences in which the elements can be accessed with the help of the index values.
2. Indexing uses square brackets [] and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab.
3. Character: h  e  l  l  o 
    index   : 0  1  2  3  4
    Reverse : 0 -4 -3 -2 -1

4. Slicing allows you to grab subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the string.
5. This has the following syntax:
    [start:stop:step]
6. Escape sequences -> \n(next line)  or \t(tab)
    print("hello \nworld) -> hello 
                             world
7. length function -> len
